## Environment Variables

To run the application, you need to set up an environment variable for The Movie Database API access token. Follow these steps:

1. Obtain an API access token from The Movie Database (TMDb).
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
3. Add the following line to the `.env` file and replace `<your-access-token>` with your actual API access token:
```REACT_APP_THEMOVIEDB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-access-token>```
4. Save the `.env` file.

The application will now be able to access The Movie Database API using the provided access token.


## Instructions

Follow these steps to run and test the React assignment:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project-directory>`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
5. Add the following environment variable to the `.env` file:
```REACT_APP_THEMOVIEDB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-access-token>```
6. Run the development server: `npm start`
7. Access the app in your browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
8. To run tests: `npm test`

## Implemented Elements

### 1. Component Architecture

The codebase demonstrates a well-organized component architecture. Components are logically structured and reusable, promoting a clean and maintainable codebase.

### 2. State Management

State management is effectively handled using Redux or React's built-in state management. Redux stores are properly configured, and components access and update state appropriately.

### 3. Routing and Navigation

The app implements routing and navigation using React Router. It ensures smooth navigation between different views and maintains consistent URLs.

### 4. API Integration

The application integrates with external APIs to fetch data. API calls are well-encapsulated and error handling is in place to provide a seamless user experience.

### 5. Responsive Design

The UI is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. Media queries or responsive design libraries are used to ensure a consistent appearance on various devices.

### 6. Unit Testing 

I have implemented unit test cases using Jest and the React Testing Library. This practice significantly contributes to improving the overall code quality and enhancing the robustness of the application.

## Possible Improvements

Given more time, the following enhancements can be made to the solution:

### 1. More Unit Test Coverage

Increase the test coverage by writing more unit tests for components, reducers, and actions. This ensures better code quality and robustness.

### 2. Accessibility

Enhance accessibility by adding appropriate ARIA attributes, ensuring keyboard navigation, and maintaining color contrast for better usability.

### 5. Code Splitting

Implement code splitting to load only the necessary components for each route, improving initial page load performance.

## Feedback

The challenge is well-structured and effectively assesses key skills required for building React applications.

Additionally, providing more context or guidelines on the expected complexity of the solution can help candidates align their efforts with the challenge requirements. Overall, the challenge provides a solid foundation for assessing React proficiency and application development skills.
